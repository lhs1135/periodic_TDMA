This implementation is from "Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) with CUDA" (HARRIS).
We reimplement their work-efficient parallel scan as discussed in Listing 2 and Figure 5.
This deals with arrays of arbitary length by using a recursive multiblock scan.
We currently do not deal with bank conflicts (pg14).
