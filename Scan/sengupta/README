This implementation is from "Scan Primitives for GPU Computing" (SENGUPTA ET AL).
We reimplement their work-efficient parallel segmented scan as discussed in Figure 1 and Algorithm 5.
This deals with arrays of arbitary length by using a recursive multiblock scan.
We do not currently deal with efficient flag representations (Section 2.2.2).
